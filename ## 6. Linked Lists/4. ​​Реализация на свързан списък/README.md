# Linked List Implementation

## Overview
This project implements a generic linked list data structure in C++ using templates. The linked list supports basic operations such as insertion, removal, and traversal. It is designed to handle various data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, and custom objects.

## Features
- **Generic Implementation**: The linked list can store different types of data using C++ templates.
- **Automatic Memory Management**: Utilizes `std::unique_ptr` to manage memory automatically, reducing the risk of memory leaks.
- **Basic Operations**:
  - Insertion at the beginning
  - Removal of nodes (head and internal nodes)
  - Traversal to display the list
  - Size tracking of the list
