Question 1:
What does the cells in the dynamic programming table represent?
a) The cells represent the results of the given subproblems
b) The cells represent average of the final solution

Question 2:
Is it true - in the main - that dynamic programming is faster than brute-force approach?
a) True
b) False

Question 3:
What is the basic concept of dynamic programming as far as extra memory usage is concerned?
a) Dynamic programming does not necessarily use extra memory
b) Dynamic programming usually uses 0(1) constant additional memory
c) Dynamic programming uses extra memory (approximately NxN additional memory) - it can reduce the running time complexity of algorithms by using additional memory (common trade-off in computer science)
