# Stack Implementations

This repository includes simple examples of how stacks work and how to implement them using arrays and linked lists. It also covers how stacks are used in memory management.

## Topics Covered

1. [What are Stacks?](#what-are-stacks)
2. [Stacks in Memory](#stacks-in-memory)
3. [Stack with Arrays](#stack-with-arrays)
4. [Stack with Linked Lists](#stack-with-linked-lists)
5. [Quiz](#quiz)

## What are Stacks?

A stack is a data structure that works on a **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** rule. You add items to the top of the stack and remove the last item added first.

## Stacks in Memory

Stacks are important in memory management, especially for handling function calls and local variables. They help manage temporary data during program execution.

## Stack with Arrays

This section shows how to build a stack using arrays. Key operations include:

- **Push**: Add an item to the stack
- **Pop**: Remove the top item from the stack
- **Peek**: Check the top item without removing it
- **isEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty

## Stack with Linked Lists

This section explains how to create a stack using linked lists. Linked lists allow you to build a stack that can grow and shrink as needed.

## Quiz

A short quiz is included to help you test what youâ€™ve learned about stacks.
