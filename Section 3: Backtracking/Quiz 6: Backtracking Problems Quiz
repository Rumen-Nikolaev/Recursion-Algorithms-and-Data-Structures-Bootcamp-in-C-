Question 1: 
What is the main problem with backtracking algorithms?
a) The main problem is that it is not clean code - hard to understand and to debug
b) The main problem is that most of the approaches still have exponential running times - not appropriate for real-world applications because they are very slow
c) The main problem is that it uses head-recursion

Question 2:
What is the main idea behind meta-heuristics?
a) It tries to find a good guess and not the exact solution - but at least the algorithm is fast
b) It tries to find the exact solution with parallel computing
c) It does not use recursion so it is faster

Question 3:
Select the meta-heuristic approach!
a) Depth-first search
b) Genetic algorithms
c) Backtracking
